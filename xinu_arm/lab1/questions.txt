1.	I expected the process to execute in the order in which they were created without 
	getting rescheduled. Print A 1000 times then B then C.
2.	The processes would get rescheduled as they ran, proc1 would print A for a while then
	proc2 B and proc3 C and they kept interchanging and running until they all printed a 1000 times.

3.	Yes, the output changed. Proc1 ran to completion(printed A 1000 times) before 
	proc2 and proc3 could even start printing their values

4.	proc3 ran and printed C 1000 times before proc1 and proc2 could start printing their values.

5. 	output using printf is different from using kprintf. The processes seemed to run an equal amount of time
	when they were rescheduled for kprintf and printf seems like they all ran for different amounts of time 
	when they were rescheduled in.
